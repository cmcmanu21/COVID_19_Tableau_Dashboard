### Overview:

This Tableau Dashboard is the result of a project from Chase Romano's Visual Analytics Course at UNC Charlotte's School of Data Science. I was tasked with creating a dashboard using a dataset from Snowflake.com's data marketplace. I chose to create a few visualizations on COVID-19 since the pandemic is still ongoing. With new variants being discovered, I felt that it was important to highlight some of the findings of new cases, vaccines, and hospitalizations. On the homepage, viewers can see each of the three dashboards, and even click on each one to get more details. In dashboard 1, I created an interactive map to display new cases by state in the lower U.S. as well as by region. Viewers have the option to view the count by each month in 2020, as well as, hovering over each state to get the new count by month. Viewers also have the option to automatically cycle through 2020 and watch the counts go up, and even move to the next dashboard with a button. On dashboard 2, viewers are greeted with the U.S. vaccine favorability and links to general information on the vaccine and where to get vaccinated. Also, viewers can see the number of people getting their second dose and the option to move to the next dashboard or previous one. Lastly, on the third dashboard, viewers can see the hospitalization rates and links to information on symptoms and where to get tested.

### Limitations and Findings:

I had to include a disclaimer at the bottom of the homepage because some of the counts did not make sense after the visualization was created. I am not sure if this was an issue on my part, or the sources used to create the datasets. The dataset also slowed my computer down tremendously and made it very difficult to create the visualizations as at times it would take minutes (or even crash Tableau) for my computer to make changes. I thought it was interesting that the central U.S. and south had the most overall new cases. This suggests that people in these regions might not have been receptive to mask-wearing and social distancing. I also found it interesting that the overwhelming majority of people got the Pfizer vaccine, and that people weren't going back to get their second vaccine. Also, hospitalization spikes seem to have occurred during the holiday season and the start of the school year.
